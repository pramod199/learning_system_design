Candidate: "Should the scheduler support only one-time tasks, or recurring tasks as well?"
Interviewer: "Both. One-time tasks run at a specific future time, and recurring tasks run repeatedly at a fixed interval."

Should recurring tasks be fixed-rate or fixed-delay?
Why it matters:
fixed-rate → cron style
fixed-delay → after previous finishes

Candidate: "Should tasks be executed exactly on time, or is a small delay acceptable?"
Interviewer: "A small delay is acceptable. We're not aiming for real-time precision, but tasks should execute as close as possible to the scheduled time. "

Candidate: "Can a task have dependencies, such that one task should only start after another completes?"

Interviewer: "yes"
Should dependent tasks start immediately after the parent finishes, or still respect their scheduled time?
Model A — schedule + dependency: run at 10:00 AND after parent
Model B — only after parent
Dependencies form a DAG (no cycles) - cyclic dependencies

Candidate: "What should happen if a task throws an exception during execution?"
Interviewer: "The exception should be caught and reported, but it should not crash the worker thread or block other tasks."

Candidate: "Can multiple tasks run in parallel?"
Interviewer: "Yes. The system should be able to run multiple tasks concurrently using a configurable number of worker threads."

Candidate: "Should we support task cancellation?"
Interviewer: "Yes, a scheduled task should be cancellable before it executes."

Candidate: "Should the scheduler support retries if a task fails?"
Interviewer: "No retries for now. However, you can keep the design open to supporting retries later."

APi:
schedule(task)
scheduleRecurring(task)
scheduleAfter(task, dependency)
cancel(taskId)
getStatus(taskId) - (important for dependency)
shutdown()
